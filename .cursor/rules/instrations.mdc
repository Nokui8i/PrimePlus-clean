# PrimePlus+ Platform Implementation Rules

## Core Requirements
1. ENGLISH ONLY - No Hebrew or any other non-English text anywhere in the application
2. NO DEMO CONTENT - Build a production-ready application without placeholder content
3. NO DUPLICATE PAGES - Each functional area should have exactly one implementation
4. CLEAN CODE - Well-structured, properly typed TypeScript with clear component separation
5. COMPLETE FEATURES - Implement all planned features before marking as complete
6. PROPER TESTING - Include unit tests and integration tests for critical features
7. SECURITY FIRST - Implement proper authentication and authorization throughout
